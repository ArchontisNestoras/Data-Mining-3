Question 2: In this project, we delve into classification algorithms applied to the Amazon reviews dataset, specifically targeting products in the "Cell Phones & Accessories" category. Our focus lies on categorizing items into "Chargers & Power Adapters" and "Car Chargers." We begin by preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features from product descriptions. Subsequently, we experiment with three classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Utilizing 5-fold cross-validation, we assess model performance, evaluating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure. Additionally, we explore alternative feature extraction methods, including embeddings via Doc2Vec and pre-existing Glove word embeddings. Results analysis involves comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms and feature representation approaches.

Question 3: This segment of our project focuses on leveraging the Personalized PageRank algorithm to predict user purchases within the context of the Amazon reviews dataset. We construct a bipartite graph from training data, representing relationships between reviewers and products. For each reviewer-product pair in the test data, we execute Personalized PageRank, ranking products based on user preferences. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit-Ratio at the top K positions (HR@K) provide insights into algorithm performance. Through analysis and interpretation of results, we aim to assess the effectiveness of Personalized PageRank in predicting user-product interactions and its potential implications for recommendation systems.
